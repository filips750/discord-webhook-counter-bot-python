This is bot that uses discord module to extract message webhooks from given channel. 
There are plenty of options to change within code like checking if message has emoji, whether message is a webhook or to search by price tag.
Please have in mind that I programmed this bot to use with NATBOT checkouts and it's really in working state.

If you have any questions regarding this bot please contact me: filips750@gmail.com
